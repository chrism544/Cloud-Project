# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
#
# This workflow automates the process of linting, testing, building, and
# deploying the application. It is triggered on every push to the `main`
# branch and on every pull request.
#
# ASSUMPTION: This pipeline is configured for a Node.js project.
# You may need to adjust the `setup-node` version and commands
# (e.g., `npm run test`) to match your specific tech stack.
